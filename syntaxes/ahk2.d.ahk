 * 
 * Otherwise, the most common usage of this parameter is an asterisk followed by the absolute path of the initially selected drive or folder. For example, "*C:\" will initially select the C drive. Similarly, "*C:\My "Folder" will initially select this special folder.
 * 
 * The asterisk indicates that the user is allowed to navigate upwards from the starting folder (close to the root directory).

One advantage of omitting the asterisk is that the StartingFolder will initially be displayed It is a tree expanded state, which can save the user time to click the plus sign in front.
 * 
 * If there is an asterisk, the upward navigation can also be restricted to folders other than the desktop. This is achieved by adding the absolute path of the topmost folder in front of the asterisk, followed by a space or tab. For example, "C:\My Folder *C:\My Folder\Projects" will not allow users to navigate to a folder higher than C:\My Folder (but the initial selection can be C:\My Folder\Projects):

 * Use (() and ()) to include literal brackets in the string. Any other invalid placeholders will be included in the result. * Space characters in the braces are not allowed (unless as a sign).
 * Each format specifier can contain the following parts in order (without spaces): `Flags Width .Precision ULT Type`
 * `Flags` Select zero or more flags from the flag table below to affect the alignment and prefix of the output.
 * 
 * -Align the result to the left under the given positioning width (padded the right part of the bit width with a space). For example, Format("{:-10}", 1) returns `1`. If omitted, the result will be given Right-justified within a fixed bit width.
 * 
 * + If the output value is a signed type, use the sign (+ or -) as the prefix. For example, Format("{:+d}", 1) returns `+1`.
 * 
 * 0 If width is prefixed with 0, leading 0 will be added up to the minimum width. For example, Format("{:010}", 1) returns `0000000001`. If both 0 and-are used, the former will be ignored. If 0 is specified as an integer format (i, u, x, X, o, d) with precision indication-for example, (:04.d)-at this time 0 will be ignored.
 * 
 * (Space) When the output value is a signed number and a positive number, it is decorated with a space as a prefix. If a space and + appear at the same time, the space will be ignored. For example, Format("{: 10}", 1) Returns `1`.
 * 
 * \# When # is used with o, x or X format, this flag uses the form of 0, 0x or 0X to modify any non-zero output value respectively. For example, Format("{:#x}", 1) returns 0x1.
 * When # is used with e, E, f, a, A format, this flag forces the output value to include a decimal point. For example, Format("{:#.0f}", 1) returns 1..
 * When # is used with g or G, this flag forces the output value to include a decimal point and retain the trailing 0.
 * When # is used with c, d, i, u or s format, it will be ignored.
 * 
 * `Width` Decimal integer, controls the minimum width of the formatted value, in characters. By default, the value is right-aligned and filled with spaces. This can be done by using-(left-aligned) and 0 (prefix 0) Sign to cover.
 * 
 * `.Precision` decimal integer, control the string to be output, the maximum number of decimal places or significant digits, depending on the output type.
 * 
 * f, e, E: Precision specifies the number of digits after the decimal point. The default value is 6.
 * 
 * g, G: Precision specifies the largest number of significant digits. The default value is 6.
 * 
 * s: Precision specifies the maximum number of characters to be printed. Characters exceeding this number will not be printed.
 * 
 * For integer types (d, i, u, x, X, o), Precision acts like Width with a prefix of 0 and a default value of 1.
 * 
 * `ULT` specifies the case conversion applied to string values - U (uppercase), L (lowercase) or T (title). Only valid for s type. For example {:U} or {:.20Ts}. Also Lowercase letters l and t are supported, but u is reserved for unsigned integers.
 * 
 * `Type` A character in the type table below that indicates how the input value will be parsed. If omitted, the default is s.
 * 
 * d or i is a signed integer.
 * 
 * u Unsigned integer.
 * 
 * x or X is an unsigned hexadecimal integer; the case of x determines whether the output value is in the form of "abcdef" or "ABCDEF". Only when the # sign is used, the 0x prefix will be included in the output value
 * 
 * o Unsigned octal integer.
 * 
 * f Floating point number The number of digits before the decimal point depends on the size of the integer part, and the number of digits after the decimal point depends on the required precision. For example, Format("{:.2f}", 1) returns 1.00.
 * 
 * e Floating point number For example, Format("{:e}", 255) returns 2.550000e+002.
 * 
 * E floating point number is equivalent to e format, but the exponent part of the result shows E instead of e.
 * 
 * g floating-point numbers display signed values in f or e format, subject to the given value and more compact precision. e format is only used when the exponent of the value is less than -4 or greater than or equal to the precision parameter. The trailing zero is Truncation, the decimal point only appears when there are one or more digits behind.
 * 
 * G floating point number is equivalent to g format, but e when introducing exponent will be replaced by E (where appropriate).
 * 
 * a floating-point number is a signed hexadecimal double-precision floating-point value in the form of [?]0xh.hhhh p±dd, where the decimal part of h.hhhh is a hexadecimal value (using lowercase letters), and dd is One or more numbers representing the exponent, and the precision specifies the number of digits after the decimal point.
 * 
 * A floating point number is equivalent to a format, but when introducing exponents, use P instead of p.
 * 
 * p integer Display the parameter as a hexadecimal memory address. For example, Format("{:p}", 255) returns 000000FF.
 * 
 * s string Output string. If the input value is a numeric value, the input value will be automatically converted to a string before Width and Precision take effect.
 * 
 * c character encoding output a single character in encoding order, similar to Chr(n). If the input value is not within the expected range, it will be reversed. For example, Format("{:c}", 116) returns t.

For GIF files, *TransWhite is likely to be useful. For PNG and TIF files, *TransBlack may be the best. Otherwise, specify N as other color names or RGB values (related For details, please refer to the color chart, or use the RGB mode of PixelGetColor).

 * wn and *hn: the width and height used to scale the image size (the width and height also determine which icon is loaded from the .ICO file with multiple icons). If both options are omitted, the ICO, DLL Or the icon loaded in the EXE file is adjusted to the system default small icon size, usually 16X16 (by specifying *w0 *h0 you can force the actual/internal size). Other images outside the icon are loaded at their actual size. To scale the image while maintaining the aspect ratio, specify -1 in one of the dimensions and a positive number in the other. For example, specifying *w200 *h-1 will scale the image to a width of 200 pixels and automatically set its height.
 * 
 * Bitmap or icon handles can be used to replace file names. For example, "HBITMAP:*" handle.

 * Arrange the contents of the variables in alphabetical, numeric or random order (you can choose whether to remove duplicates).

 * 
 * C: Case-sensitive sorting (if there is an N option, this option is ignored). If both C and CL are omitted, the uppercase letters A-Z are considered equivalent to their corresponding lowercase forms in the sorting.
 * 
 * CL: Case-insensitive sorting based on the current user locale. For example, most English and Western European regions equate the letters AZ and ANSI letters (such as Ä and Ü) to their lowercase forms. This method also uses " Word sorting", it handles hyphens and apostrophes in this way (words like "coop" and "co-op" are kept together). According to the content of the sorted item, its execution performance is indistinguishable than the default The method is 1 to 8 times worse.
 * 
 * Dx: Specify x as the delimiter, which determines the start and end position of each item. If this option does not exist, x defaults to a newline character (`n), so when the string is lined with LF (`n) Or CR+LF(`r`n) can be sorted correctly at the end.
 * 
 * N: Number sorting: each item is assumed to be sorted as a number instead of a string (for example, if this option does not exist, the string 233 is considered to be less than the string 40 according to the alphabetical order). Decimal and hexadecimal Strings (such as 0xF1) are considered to be numbers. Strings that do not start with a number are treated as zeros in sorting. The number is treated as a 64-bit floating point value, so that each digit in the fractional part ( If there is).
 * 
 * Pn: Sort items according to character position n (not using hexadecimal n) (each item is compared from the nth character). If this option is not used, n defaults to 1, which is the first The position of the character. Sorting will start from the nth character to compare each string with other strings. If n is greater than the length of any string, the string will be treated as blank when sorting. When with the option When N (number sort) is used together, the character position of the string will be used, which is not necessarily the same as the number position of the number.
 * 
 * R: Reverse sorting (alphabetical or numerical sorting according to other options).
 * 
 * Random: Random sorting. This option will cause other options except D, Z and U to be ignored (Nevertheless, N, C and CL will still affect the detection of duplicates).
 * 
 * U: Remove duplicate items in the list so that each item is unique. If the C option is valid, the case of the items must match to be considered equivalent. If the N option is valid, then items like 2 Will be considered as a duplicate of 2.0. If the Pn or \(backslash) option is valid, the entire item must be the same to be regarded as a duplicate, not just a substring used for sorting. If the Random option or custom sorting Effective, the duplicates will be deleted only when there are adjacent duplicates in the sorting result. For example, when "A|B|A" is sorted randomly, the result may contain one or two A's.
 * 
 * Z: To understand this option, please consider the variable whose content is RED`nGREEN`nBLUE`n. If the Z option does not exist, the last newline character (`n) will be considered as part of the last item, so the variable There are only three items. But if option Z is specified, the last `n (if it exists) will be considered to separate the last empty item in the list, so there are four items in the variable (the last one is empty).
 * 
 * \: Sort according to the substring after the last backslash in each item. If the item does not contain a backslash, the entire item is used as the sorted substring. This option can be used to sort individual file names (I.e. does not include the path)
 * @param Callback The function must accept three parameters: `MyFunction(first, second, offset)`
 * 
 * When the function thinks that the first parameter is greater than the second parameter, it should return a positive integer; when the two parameters are judged to be equal, it should return 0, "", or empty; otherwise, it should return a negative integer. If it returns If there is a decimal part in the value, the part is ignored (i.e. 0.8 is equivalent to 0).
 * 
 * If present, the third parameter receives the offset (in characters) of the second item from the first item, as seen in the original/unsorted list (see example).
 * 
 * This function uses the same global (or thread-specific) settings as the sorting function that called it.
 * 
 * `Note:` When there is a Callback, all options except D, Z and U will be ignored (although N, C and CL will still affect the detection of duplicates).

	 * 
	 * C: Set CaseSensitive to true to make MatchList case sensitive.
	 * 
	 * I: Set MinSendLevel to 1 or a given value, so that any input with an input level lower than this value is ignored. For example, I2 will ignore any input with level 0 (default) or 1, but will capture any input with level 2 enter.

	 * 
	 * ·*: Wildcard. Set FindAnywhere to true to allow matches to be found anywhere the user types.
	 * 
	 * E: Handling single-character end keys by character code instead of key code. If the keyboard layout of the active window is different from that of the script, it can provide more consistent results. It also prevents the given end character from actually being generated The key combination to end Input; for example, if @ is the end key, Shift+2 will trigger it on the American keyboard, but Ctrl+Shift+2 will not trigger (when using the E option). If you also use C Option, the ending character is case sensitive.
	 * @param EndKeys A list of zero or more keys, where any key terminates input when pressed (the end key itself will not be written into the input buffer). When Input is terminated in this way, EndReason is set to The word EndKey, EndKey properties are set to the name of the key.
	 * 
	 * The EndKeys list uses a format similar to the Send function. For example, specifying {Enter}.{Esc} will cause either Enter,. Or Esc to terminate the Input. Using the brace itself as the end key, specify {{} and /or{}}.
	 * 
	 * To use Ctrl, Alt or Shift as the end key, please specify the left and/or right version of the key instead of the neutral version. For example, specify {LControl}{RControl} instead of (Control).
	 * 
	 * Although modifier keys such as Alt+C(!c) are not supported, instead of alphanumeric characters (such as?!:@&()) by default, the Shift key is required to be pressed or not, depending on the normal input of characters Method. If there is an E option, a single character key name is interpreted as a character. In this case, the modifier key must be in the correct state to generate the character. When the E and M options are used at the same time, by including in EndKeys Corresponding ASCII control characters to support Ctrl+A to Ctrl+Z.
	 * 
	 * You can also specify a clear virtual key code, such as {vkFF} or {sc001}. This is very useful in rare cases where the key has no name and does not produce visible characters when pressed. Its virtual key code can be found at the bottom of the key list page The steps to determine.
	 * @param MatchList is a comma-separated list of keywords, any of which will cause the input to be terminated (in this case, EndReason will be set to the word Match). The content entered by the user must exactly match a certain phrase in the match list (Unless there is an * option). In addition, any spaces or tabs around the delimiter comma are meaningful, which means they are part of the matching string. For example, if MatchList is ABC, XYZ, then the user must Type a space after ABC or before XYZ to form a match.
	 * 
	 * Two consecutive commas produce a single literal comma. For example, the following match list will produce a single literal comma at the end of string1: string1,,,string2. Similarly, the following match list contains only one literal comma Single item: single,,item.
	 * 
	 * Because the items in MatchList are not treated as separate parameters, the list can be completely contained in a variable. In fact, if the length of this list exceeds 16383, then all or part of the list must be contained in the variable because of this length Is the maximum length of any script line.

	 * Set the options of the key or key list.
	 * @param Keys key list. Braces are used to enclose key names, virtual key codes or scan codes, similar to the Send function. For example, {Enter}.{{} will be applied to Enter,. and {. By name, press {vkNN} or pressing the designated key of {scNNN} may produce three different results; for details, see below.
	 * 
	 * Separately specify the string (All) (not case sensitive) to apply KeyOptions to all VKs and all SCs. Then you can call KeyOpt again to delete options from a specific key.
	 * @param KeyOptions One or more of the following single-character options (spaces and tabs).
	 * 
	 * -(Minus sign): Remove any options after-until the next +.
	 * 
	 * + (Plus sign): cancel any previous -, otherwise invalid.
	 * 
	 * E: End key. If enabled, press the key to terminate Input, set EndReason to the word EndKey, and set the EndKey property to the standard name of the key. Unlike the EndKeys parameter, the state of the Shift key will be ignored. For example, @ and 2 Both are equivalent to {vk32} in the American keyboard layout.
	 * 
	 * I: Ignore text. Normally any text generated by the key will be ignored, and the key will be treated as a non-text key (see VisibleNonText). If the key normally does not produce text, it has no effect.
	 * 
	 * N: Notification. OnKeyDown and OnKeyUp callbacks are called every time a key is pressed.
	 * 
	 * S: Suppress (block) the key press after processing it. This will overwrite VisibleText or VisibleNonText until -S is used. +S means -V.
	 * 
	 * V: Visible. Prevents key presses from being suppressed (blocked). This will override VisibleText or VisibleNonText until -V is used. +V means -S.
